Manifest Evaluation and Quality tooling

> In policy we trust!

== About

NOTE: Mequal is in very early stage. Over the next weeks this repository will be populated
with documentation and examples.

Mequal's project goal is to *improve quality and security of software*.

It is done by evaluating policies against manifests (BOMs). The outcome
of the evaluation can be used to make decisions whether the software
quality is good or not.

Policies can be freely defined. But we will help with guidelines.
Our aim is to standardize and categorize policies. Mequal will come
with a curated list of policies to get you started as well!
